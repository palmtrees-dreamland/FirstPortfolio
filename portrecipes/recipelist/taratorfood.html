    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Balkan food has some tasty dishes. This 
        is a cold soup, or Tarator. Consumed mostly during 
        summer, it is actually one of my fave dishes 
        and I enjoy it all year round as a drinkable
        appetizer to accompany mains during lunch time.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cucumber</li>
        <li>1 plain yoghurt</li>
        <li>Fresh dill</li>
        <li>A bit of chopped garlic</li>

        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
       <li>
           Diced desire amount of cucumber, the 
           smaller the better so you can chew on those 
           little bits.
       </li>
       <br>
       <li>
           Pour the yoghurt in a jug and whisk so it 
           gets a bit liquid.
       </li>
       <br>
       <li>
           Add the diced cucumber, a bit of garlic 
           and walnuts.
       </li>
       <br>
       <li>
           Stir and add some olive oil and dill.
       </li>
       <br>
       <li>
           Finally, it is time to add some water. Now,
           it depends on you how thick you want it to 
           be
